<h2>What will happen if we do nothing ?</h2>

<p>According to a report by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), 
    the global temperature of the planet should increase by 1.5% between 2021 and 2024. 
    This will lead to disasters such as rising sea levels or melting glaciers, which would be irreversible catastrophes.</p>

<h2>« The environment, the n°1 concern of young people »</h2>

<p>According to a study conducted by CREDOC for ADEME, the environment would be the main concern of young people, 
    even exceeding unemployment.</p>

<h2>Paradoxical consumption</h2>

<p>Young people seem very involved in respecting the environment, unfortunately, 
    this is not always the case in real situation, for example, when faced with a food product, 
    56% of young people choose the cheapest brand rather than an eco-responsible brand. That said, 
    this is surely due to a financial problem on their part that makes them unable to afford eco-responsible products.</p>

<h2>Concrete actions</h2>

<p>Regarding daily travel, young people have more ecological habits than previous generations. 
    They prefer walking, biking, public transportation and carpooling. 
    This last practice is very popular among 18-24 year olds: about 1 in 2 young people use carpooling for short or 
    long distances.</p>

<h2>How to act ?</h2>

<p>To act effectively at our level, we can apply simple actions such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Sorting your waste</li>
    <li>Turn off your electronic devices when you are away</li>
    <li>Buying second hand</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Feeling of being alone</h2>

<p>Young people are motivated to change the world, unfortunately, they often feel powerless. 
    1 out of 3 young people think that it is companies that can have a real impact on changing things, 
    they would also like to see the government take more concrete actions such as implementing 
    laws banning over-packaging in companies or pushing companies and institutions 
    to take concrete action for the environment. They would like to see positive developments in companies, 
    not feeling like they are the only ones to act.</p>
